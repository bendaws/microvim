Hey! Thanks for installing MicroVim!

If you're seeing this, MicroVim is installed and ready for use.

Press "i" to enter Insert mode. Insert mode lets you write text
to the screen.

When you're done editing, enter Normal mode by pressing ESC.

If you're already a Vim user, this has a decent learning curve.
