# Plugins have been removed in 4.1m3. Why?
Lua support has been difficult to implement since I am not familiar with the Lua C API. This is my own editor; so most changes are done on preference.

## What will happen for plugins now?
Lua 5.1 is not outdated, but I largely prefer the more popular Lua 5.4. I will begin implementing Lua 5.4 today (Oct 21, 2024).
