                         WHAT IS MICROVIM?
=======================================================================
MicroVim is a super small Vim-like text editor designed for myself
because I don't wanna learn how to use Vim. It replicates many of it's
core features, and should hopefully be pretty easy to pick up if you
know super-core Vim basics.

                             FEATURES
=======================================================================
- Two modes (regular and insert). Regular mode lets you quit and do
  commands. Insert mode lets you write text in the file.
- 100% open-source and hand-written components.
- Cross-platform (assuming you rebuild)
- Pretty readable code.
- SUPER SUPER small. Under 2K lines of code.

                              INSTALL
=======================================================================
Use GNU make

        make microvim # Required. builds the editor

        make install-mvim # Install to /usr/local/bin with the name
                            "mvim"
        make install-microvim # Install to /usr/local/bin with the
                                name "microvim"
        
        make install-both # Copies both names to /usr/local/bin
