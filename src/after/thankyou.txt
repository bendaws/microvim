Hey! Thanks for installing MicroVim! If you're seeing this, MicroVim
is installed and ready for use.

Press "i" to enter Insert mode. Insert mode lets you write text
to the screen.

Use your arrow keys to move around the editor.

When you're done editing, enter Normal mode by pressing ESC (escape).

If you're already a Vim user, this has a decent learning curve.
